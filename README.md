1) INTRODUCTION
In today's world, music is a big part of our lives, especially with the rise of online platforms and streaming
services. We have access to an incredible variety of songs and albums, but sometimes it can feel like finding
the perfect music for our mood or occasion is like searching for a needle in a haystack. That's where our
project comes in â€“ we're creating something special: a Music Album Web Application.
The LyricLoom application is like a huge online library filled with all kinds of music albums, from the latest
chart-toppers to the timeless classics that never go out of style. Imagine having all your favourite albums
and artists just a click away, no matter where you are or what device you are using. For users, MAMS offers
a easier browsing experience, allowing them to discover new music, explore album collections, and engage
with their favourite artists and albums. Through personalized recommendations and search functionalities,
MAMS powers users to discover music that matches with their tastes and preferences.
